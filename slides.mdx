# Machine Learning in React Native

John Paul Ada

## React Native

A React **renderer** that **renders to native** mobile components,
allowing us to create near-native mobile apps in both **Android** and **iOS** with the same code.

---

## Machine Learning

Allows a machine to **learn by experiencing** something,
which allows us to do things with a computer **without explicitly programming** it to do so.
