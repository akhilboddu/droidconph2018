# Machine Learning in React Native

John Paul Ada

---

## React Native

A React **renderer** that **renders to native** mobile components,
allowing us to create near-native mobile apps in both **Android** and **iOS** with the same code.

---

## Machine Learning

Allows a machine to **learn by experiencing** something,
which allows us to do things with a computer **without explicitly programming** it to do so.

## Approaches to Machine Learning in React Native

*How It Was Built* **+** *How To Access It*

---

### Azure ML Studio

----

*How It Was Built*: **Drag and Drop**

*How To Access It*: **REST API**

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Requesting from Azure ML Studio"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/azure-ml.js")}
  lang="javascript"
  showNumbers={true}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    { notes: "Fetch and display code"},
    { lines: [1], notes: "Make a fetch request to the Azure ML URL" },
    { lines: [2], notes: "Using a POST HTTP Method" },
    { range: [3, 7], notes: "Add headers" },
    { lines: [5], notes: "Use the Azure ML API Key" },
    { range: [8, 16], notes: "Add the body of the request"},
    { range: [19, 21], notes: "Get the value that we want from the request"},
    { lines: [23], notes: "Display the value in a dialog" },
  ]}
/>

### Python model + GraphQL

----

*How It Was Built*: **Python library**

*How To Access It*: **GraphQL API**

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Predicting the Face"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/predict.graphql")}
  lang="graphql"
  showNumbers={true}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    { notes: "PredictFace mutation"},
    { lines: [2], notes: "Accepts an imageData string that is a base64 encoded image" },
    { lines: [3], notes: "Returns the names as a list of strings" },
  ]}
/>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Executing the Mutation"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/predict.js")}
  lang="javascript"
  showNumbers={true}
  dark={true}
  steps={[
    { notes: "Process the mutation request"},
    { range: [1, 3], notes: "Runs the mutation given the base64 of an image as an argument" },
    { lines: [5], notes: "Gets the list of the names from the response" },
    { lines: [7], notes: "Displays the list on a dialog box" },
  ]}
/>

---

### TensorFlow.js

----

*How It Was Built*: **tfjs-node**

*How To Access It*: **Reading files**
